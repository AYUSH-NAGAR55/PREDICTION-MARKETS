# PREDICTION MARKETS

## Project Description

Prediction Markets is a decentralized smart contract platform that enables users to create and participate in prediction markets on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create markets about future events, place bets on different outcomes, and earn rewards based on accurate predictions. The platform operates transparently with automated payouts and minimal platform fees.

The smart contract handles the entire lifecycle of prediction markets - from creation to resolution and payout distribution. It ensures fair play through blockchain transparency and immutable smart contract logic.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize prediction markets by creating a trustless, decentralized platform where anyone can:

- **Create Markets**: Launch prediction markets on any future event or outcome
- **Participate Freely**: Place bets without intermediaries or excessive fees  
- **Earn Rewards**: Get paid automatically when predictions are correct
- **Access Transparency**: Benefit from blockchain's immutable and transparent nature

We aim to build the infrastructure for decentralized forecasting, enabling collective intelligence to emerge through market mechanisms while maintaining complete transparency and user control.
